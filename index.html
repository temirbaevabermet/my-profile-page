    <img src="images\myPhoto.jpg" alt="my-photo" class="img1" />
    <p class="alegreya-sans-regular">Hello, my name is Bermet. I'm 18 years old. I am currently a student at Ala-Too University, and studying in IT  faculty.  My goal in the future is to become a professional in this field.Let's talk more about me. I can describe myself as responsible, fair, stubborn, patient, touchy, reserved, and sometimes even an unstable person. Acquaintances often say that I am a very serious person, and I look just as serious, but it's isn't like that. Cause with my close people I can be completely different(like more sociable, kind, generous e.t.c.).
    </p>
    <p class="alegreya-sans-regular"> I’m not interested in many things, but I still have my favorite activities or hobbies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="alegreya-sans-regular" style="color: midnightblue;">Volleybal</li>
        <li class="alegreya-sans-regular" style="color: midnightblue;">Swimming</li>
        <li class="alegreya-sans-regular" style="color: midnightblue;">Drawing</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="itim-regular" style="color: midnightblue;">Volleyball: I started playing volleyball two years ago, the reason for this was my friend  who was really good at this sport. After watching volleyball competitions, I began to be interested in volleyball. Now this sport is an integral part of my life.</p>
    <p class="itim-regular" style="color: midnightblue;">Swimming: I started going swimming in the eighth grade. At that time I did not know how to swim, this became the reason to try myself in this sport. I love swimming because it brings me peace and tranquility.
    </p>
    <p class="itim-regular" style="color: midnightblue;">Drawing: I love drawing people, especially anime characters. As I remember, I have been drawing since childhood, and over time my abilities have improved a lot. The pictures above are my works.
    </p>
    <p class="alegreya-sans-regular">I choose programming because in the future I want to create my own apps, specifically- games.Creating games I think it's really interesting thing, like make your own codes, characters, logic operators for your game. It's fantastic, isn't it?! With the helping of university I want to learn more about this field, become professional. Now I don’t have any great success in this activity, but little by little we are creating our own programs, and this seems to me like a good start.
